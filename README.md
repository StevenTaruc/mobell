## Inspiration
Yesterday our team member Katy witnessed someone become isolated and excluded. She saw how a man in a wheelchair couldnâ€™t open the door to the cafe she was in, and felt angered that the employees did not do anything to help him. The purpose of ***Mobell*** is to allow those who suffer any mobile disability gain help through an accessible app.

## What it does
It is a portable notification system that allows one needing assistance to click a button and get it. The nearest employee with the app will get notified that assistance is needed and can locate where the user is. The user can personalize the app to needs that are most necessary to them. Employees would be trained on how the app works, and would want to help others because their manager could view statistics regarding amount of people helped, quality of their service, and more through a web interface.

## How we built it
We built this app using the technologies Google Firebase on the backend and wrote an app for Android-based mobile devices using Android Studio.

## Challenges I ran into
Initially, we ran into the first issue of not knowing how to develop a mobile application, much less the Android-specific nuances of the Java language.
Through thoughtful planning of our time, and utilizing our resources (our mentors), we were able to develop an understanding of the technologies required to complete our project.
To put this succinctly, this was a "trial by fire" for all of the developers involved in this project.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of


## What we learned
We learned a lot throughout this experience. These things include:

    * How disabilities can touch virtually all aspects of our lives, even if we do not realize it
    * How to use Google's Firebase platform for application development
    * How to plan, structure, develop, test, and deploy an mobile application for Android-based operating systems?


## What's next for ***Mobell***
Here are some of the features we would like for ***Mobell***:

    * Add a user experience section to ***Mobell***. This could be where users share their good experiences or where a user can search to see which businesses are ***Mobell*** verified.
    * Port this code over to the Apple iOS platform. This allows us to reach a broader audience, which would allow us to affect more people, and ultimately, make the world a better place by increasing inclusivity.
    * General user interface/user experience (UI/UX) improvements as we continue to work with our customers to ensure the application suits their needs.
